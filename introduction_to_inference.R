#Introduction to Inference

# 1. Sample average
# `N` represents the number of people polled
N <- 25

# `p` represents the proportion of Democratic voters
p <- 0.45

# Calculate the standard error of the spread. Print this value to the console.
2* sqrt(p*(1-p)/N)

# 2. Distribution of errors - 1
# Define `p` as the proportion of Democrats in the population being polled
p <- 0.45

# Define `N` as the number of people polled
N <- 100

# The variable `B` specifies the number of times we want the sample to be replicated
B <- 10000

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling
set.seed(1)

# Create an objected called `errors` that replicates subtracting the result of the `take_sample` function from `p` for `B` replications
errors <- replicate(B,
p - take_sample(p,N)
)

# Calculate the mean of the errors. Print this value to the console.
mean(errors)

# 3. Average size of error
# Define `p` as the proportion of Democrats in the population being polled
p <- 0.45

# Define `N` as the number of people polled
N <- 100

# The variable `B` specifies the number of times we want the sample to be replicated
B <- 10000

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling
set.seed(1)

# We generated `errors` by subtracting the estimate from the actual proportion of Democratic voters
errors <- replicate(B, p - take_sample(p, N))

# Calculate the mean of the absolute value of each simulated error. Print this value to the console.
mean(abs(errors))

# 4. Standard deviation of the spread
# Define `p` as the proportion of Democrats in the population being polled
p <- 0.45

# Define `N` as the number of people polled
N <- 100

# The variable `B` specifies the number of times we want the sample to be replicated
B <- 10000

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling
set.seed(1)

# We generated `errors` by subtracting the estimate from the actual proportion of Democratic voters
errors <- replicate(B, p - take_sample(p, N))

# Calculate the standard deviation of `errors`
sqrt(mean(errors^2))

# 5. Estimating the standard error
# Define `p` as the expected value equal to 0.45
p <- 0.45

# Define `N` as the sample size
N <- 100

# Calculate the standard error
sqrt(p*(1-p)/N)

# 6. Standard error of the estimate
# Define `p` as a proportion of Democratic voters to simulate
p <- 0.45

# Define `N` as the sample size
N <- 100

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling
set.seed(1)

# Define `X` as a random sample of `N` voters with a probability of picking a Democrat ('1') equal to `p`
X <- sample(c(1,0), N, replace=TRUE, prob = c(p,1-p))

# Define `X_bar` as the average sampled proportion
X_bar <- mean(X)

# Calculate the standard error of the estimate. Print the result to the console.
sqrt(X_bar*(1-X_bar)/N)

# 7. Plotting the errors
# Define `p` as the proportion of Democrats in the population being polled
p <- 0.45

# Define `N` as the number of people polled
N <- 100

# The variable `B` specifies the number of times we want the sample to be replicated
B <- 10000

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling
set.seed(1)

# Generate `errors` by subtracting the estimate from the actual proportion of Democratic voters
errors <- replicate(B, p - take_sample(p, N))

# Generate a qq-plot of `errors` with a qq-line showing a normal distribution
qqnorm(errors)
qqline(errors)

# 8. Estimating the probability of a specific value of X-bar
# Define `p` as the proportion of Democrats in the population being polled
p <- 0.45

# Define `N` as the number of people polled
N <- 100

# Calculate the probability that the estimated proportion of Democrats in the population is greater than 0.5. Print this value to the consol
se <- sqrt(p*(1-p)/N)
1 - pnorm(0.5, p, se)

# 9. Estimating the probability of a specific error size
# Define `N` as the number of people polled
N <-100

# Define `X_hat` as the sample average
X_hat <- 0.51

# Define `se_hat` as the standard error of the sample average
se_hat <- sqrt(X_hat*(1-X_hat)/N)

# Calculate the probability that the error is 0.01 or larger
1 - (pnorm(0.52,X_hat,se_hat) - pnorm(0.50,X_hat,se_hat))
